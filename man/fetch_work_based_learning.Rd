fetch_work_based_learning(end_year, level = "school")
}
\arguments{
\item{end_year}{A school year (2017-2024). Year is the end of the academic

\item{level}{One of "school" or "district". "school" returns school-level
data, "district" returns district and state-level data.}
}
\value{
Data frame with work-based learning participation including:
  \itemize{
    \item end_year, county_id, county_name, district_id, district_name
    \item school_id, school_name (for school-level data)
    \item career_cluster - Career cluster area
    \item students_participating - Number of students in work-based learning
    \item pct_participating - Percentage participating in this career cluster
    \item Aggregation flags (is_state, is_county, is_district, is_school, is_charter)
  }
