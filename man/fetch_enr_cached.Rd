\title{Fetch enrollment data with caching}
\usage{
fetch_enr_cached(end_year, tidy = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{end_year}{A school year. Year is the end of the academic year - eg 2006-07
school year is year '2007'. Valid values are 2000-2025.}

\item{tidy}{If TRUE, takes the unwieldy wide data and normalizes into a
long, tidy data frame with limited headers - constants (school/district name and code),
subgroup (all the enrollment file subgroups), program/grade and measure (row_total, free lunch, etc).}
}
\value{
Enrollment data frame (from cache if available)
}
\description{
This is a cached wrapper around \code{\link{fetch_enr}}. On the first call
with a given set of parameters, data is downloaded from NJ DOE. Subsequent
calls with the same parameters return cached data instantly.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# First call downloads data
enr <- fetch_enr_cached(2024)

# Second call returns cached data
enr <- fetch_enr_cached(2024)  # Instant!

# Check cache status
njsd_cache_info()
}
