\title{Fetch 6-Year Graduation Rate data}
\usage{
fetch_6yr_grad_rate(end_year, level = "school")
}
\arguments{
\item{end_year}{A school year. Year is the end of the academic year - eg
2020-21 school year is end_year '2021'. Valid values are 2021-2024.}

\item{level}{One of "school" or "district". "school" returns school-level
data, "district" returns district and state-level data.}
}
\value{
dataframe with 6-year graduation rates including:
  \itemize{
    \item end_year, county_id, county_name, district_id, district_name
    \item school_id, school_name (for school-level data)
    \item subgroup - student group (total population, racial/ethnic groups, etc.)
    \item grad_rate_6yr - 6-year graduation rate (0-100 scale)
    \item continuing_rate - percentage of students still enrolled after 6 years
    \item non_continuing_rate - percentage who dropped out or left
    \item persistence_rate - graduates + continuing students (high school persistence)
    \item Aggregation flags (is_state, is_district, is_school, is_charter)
  }
}
\description{
Downloads and processes 6-year graduation rate data from the NJ School
Performance Reports database. This data shows the percentage of students
who graduated within six years of entering high school.
}
\details{
The 6-year graduation data is from a different source than the 4-year and
5-year data (SPR database vs ACGR files), which is why it has its own
fetch function rather than being an option in \code{fetch_grad_rate()}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get 2024 school-level 6-year graduation rates
grad6_2024 <- fetch_6yr_grad_rate(2024)

# Get district-level 6-year graduation rates
grad6_dist <- fetch_6yr_grad_rate(2024, level = "district")
}
}
