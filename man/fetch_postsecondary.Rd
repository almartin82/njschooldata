\title{Fetch Postsecondary Enrollment Rates}
\usage{
fetch_postsecondary()
}
\value{
A data frame with postsecondary enrollment rates in long format,
  containing columns for county, district, school identifiers, cohort_year,
  measurement_type (fall or 16_month), lower_bound, and upper_bound.
}
\description{
Downloads postsecondary enrollment rate data from the NJ DOE website.
Data is sourced from the National Student Clearinghouse and shows the
percentage of high school graduates enrolling in postsecondary institutions.
}
\details{
The data includes both school-level and district-level rates. Rates are
reported as ranges because a small percentage of graduates cannot be
matched to the National Student Clearinghouse database.

Two measurement types are available:
\itemize{
  \item \code{fall}: Enrollment in fall immediately after graduation
  \item \code{16_month}: Enrollment within 16 months of graduation
}

The \code{lower_bound} represents confirmed enrollments only (conservative).
The \code{upper_bound} assumes non-matched graduates also enrolled (optimistic).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get all postsecondary enrollment data
postsec <- fetch_postsecondary()

# Filter for 16-month rates only
postsec_16mo <- postsec[postsec$measurement_type == "16_month", ]

# Filter for district-level data only
district_rates <- postsec[postsec$is_district, ]
}
}
