\title{Track ESSA Progress Over Time}
\usage{
track_essa_progress_over_time(df_list, school_id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_list}{A named list of data frames from different years. Each element
should be named by its end_year (e.g., list("2020" = df_2020, "2024" = df_2024)).
Data frames should be from \code{\link{fetch_essa_status}}.}

\item{school_id}{Optional school code to track a specific school (e.g., "010")}
}
\value{
List with two elements:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{longitudinal} - Data frame with one row per school-year combination:
      \itemize{
        \item end_year - School year
        \item county_id, district_id, school_id - Location identifiers
        \item school_name - School name
        \item category_of_identification - ESSA status category
        \item focus_level - Categorized support level (Comprehensive/Targeted/Other/None)
        \item status_change - Change from previous year:
          "Improvement", "Decline", "Stable", "First Year", or "Insufficient Data"
      }
    \item \code{transitions} - Data frame with transition summary statistics:
      \itemize{
        \item from_status - Status in previous year
        \item to_status - Status in current year
        \item n_schools - Number of schools with this transition
        \item pct_schools - Percentage of all transitions
      }
    \item \code{summary} - List with summary statistics:
      \itemize{
        \item n_schools_tracked - Total unique schools tracked
        \item n_years - Number of years in data
        \item n_improvements - Number of schools showing improvement
        \item n_declines - Number of schools showing decline
      }
  }
}
\description{
Tracks ESSA accountability status changes across multiple years, identifying
improvement trajectories, calculating transition probabilities, and summarizing
patterns in school accountability status.
